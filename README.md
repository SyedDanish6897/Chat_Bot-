# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot (with Random Responses)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **simple rule-based chatbot** built in Python.
The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined keywords and uses random fallback responses when it doesn’t understand the query.

It demonstrates:

* **Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with keyword matching.
* **Input/Output loops** for continuous conversation.
* **Randomized responses** to make the chatbot more natural.

## 🚀 Features

* Responds to greetings like `"hi"` or `"hello"`.
* Can answer basic queries such as `"who is Salman Khan"` or `"what is your name"`.
* Exits the conversation when the user types `"bye"`.
* Provides **random fallback responses** if the query is not recognized.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Random Module** → used to select varied fallback responses.
